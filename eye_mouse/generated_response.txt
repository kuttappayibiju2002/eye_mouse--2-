Active means engaged or operating.  To understand what "active" means, I need more context.  For example:

* **"Is the volcano active?"**  This asks if the volcano is currently erupting or showing signs of imminent eruption.
* **"She's an active member of the club."** This means she participates regularly and contributes.
* **"The account is active."** This means the account is currently functional and accessible.
* **"He lives an active lifestyle."** This means he engages in regular physical activity.


Please provide more context so I can give you a more precise answer.
