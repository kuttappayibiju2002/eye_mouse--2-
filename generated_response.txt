CANCCL doesn't appear to be a widely recognized acronym or abbreviation.  To help me understand what it means, could you please provide more context?  For example:

* **Where did you see this acronym?** (e.g., a website, a document, a conversation)
* **What is the topic or subject matter?** (e.g., science, technology, business, a specific organization)

With more information, I might be able to figure out what CANCCL stands for.
